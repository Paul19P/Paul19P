### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello there! I'm Paul, a Computer Science student at the University of Bucharest with a passion for programming. I've been practicing since high school and I am eager to learn and ramp up my skills even more through my first job internship. I enjoy collaborating with others and taking on new challenges. Let's connect and create some awesome software together!
